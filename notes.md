# Things to Fix

- [ ] Do not allow registering twice!
- [ ] Some database errors, like 'duplicate key', shouldn't yield 500 errors
- [ ] Can/Should you run a franchise without franchise admins??
- [ ] Should only the admin get access to a list of users?
- [ ] Create a CloudFormation stack that can automatically tear down and redeploy by following [these instructions](https://github.com/devops329/devops/blob/main/instruction/jwtPizzaServiceInfrastructureAutomation/jwtPizzaServiceInfrastructureAutomation.md).
